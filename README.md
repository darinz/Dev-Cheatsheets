# Dev Cheatsheets

A curated collection of practical reference guides for developers and data scientists. This repository includes essential usage examples and explanations for Git, Unix/Linux commands, Node.js version management with NVM, NPM usage, best practices for keeping your repositories clean (e.g., ignoring `.DS_Store` files on macOS) and much more.


## Contents

  Common Git commands for version control, branching, commits, stashing, and remotes.

- [Linux and Unix Commands](./linux-unix-commands.md)  
  A handy reference for frequently used Unix/Linux command-line operations with examples.

- [Python Virtual Environment Setup Reference](./python-venv.md)  
  Covering both `venv` (built-in Python tool) and `conda` (Anaconda/Miniconda).

- [NVM & NPM Reference](./nvm-npm.md)  
  Instructions for managing Node.js versions with NVM and handling packages with NPM.

- [Ignore `.DS_Store` Files](./git-ignore-dsstore.md)  
  Best practices for ignoring `.DS_Store` files globally or per project in macOS Git workflows.


## Usage

These reference files are designed for quick lookup and onboarding. You can:

- Clone this repo:
  
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/darinz/Dev-Cheatsheets.git
```

* Bookmark the repo for regular use.
* Copy snippets directly into your terminal or shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.).
* Share with teammates or contributors as a unified knowledge base.


## Recommended Setup (Optional)

If you're working across multiple environments, consider:

* Setting up a global `.gitignore` to avoid common OS/system artifacts.
* Using NVM to manage Node.js versions per project.
* Running `npm audit` regularly to ensure secure dependency trees.
